## Example Dialogue to Showcase

**Problem**: 2x + 5 = 13

**Conversation**:
```
Tutor: "What are we trying to find?"
Student: "x"
Tutor: "Exactly! To get x alone, we need to undo the operations. What operation is being applied to x first?"
Student: "Adding 5"
Tutor: "Right! So if we're adding 5, how can we undo that? What's the opposite of addition?"
Student: "Subtraction"
Tutor: "Perfect! So what should we do to both sides of the equation?"
```
