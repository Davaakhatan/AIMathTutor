name: Deploy to AWS Amplify

# NOTE: This workflow is OPTIONAL
# AWS Amplify automatically deploys when you connect GitHub repository
# You only need this if you want to trigger deployments via GitHub Actions
# 
# To use this workflow, you need to set up GitHub Secrets:
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  
# - AWS_REGION
# - AMPLIFY_APP_ID
#
# If you haven't set these up, AWS Amplify will still auto-deploy from GitHub
# You can disable this workflow or set up the secrets

on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Only manual triggering (optional)
  # Comment out push trigger if you want Amplify to handle auto-deployment
  # push:
  #   branches:
  #     - main

  deploy:
    name: Deploy to AWS Amplify
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
