# Project Brief: AI Math Tutor - Socratic Learning Assistant

## Project Overview
Build an AI-powered math tutor that guides students through problem-solving using Socratic questioning methodology. The system helps students discover solutions through guided dialogue rather than providing direct answers.

## Core Objective
Create an educational tool that:
- Accepts math problems via text or image upload
- Engages students in Socratic dialogue to guide learning
- Maintains conversation context throughout the session
- Adapts to student understanding level
- Never provides direct answers, only guidance

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Guides students through 5+ problem types without giving direct answers
- ✅ Maintains conversation context across multiple turns
- ✅ Adapts to student understanding level
- ✅ Clean, intuitive web interface
- ✅ Proper math equation rendering (LaTeX/KaTeX)
- ✅ Reliable problem parsing from text and images

## Timeline
- **Core Features**: 3-5 days
- **Stretch Features**: Days 6-7 (optional)
- **Target Completion**: November 3, 2025

## Key Constraints
- Must use Socratic method (no direct answers)
- Should work with printed text initially (handwritten can be stretch)
- Must support multiple problem types: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, word problems, multi-step

## Deliverables
1. Deployed application (or local with clear setup)
2. GitHub repository with clean code structure
3. Documentation: README with setup, 5+ example walkthroughs, prompt engineering notes
4. 5-minute demo video demonstrating core features
