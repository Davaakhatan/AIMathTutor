```
Tutor: I see you're working on: 2x + 5 = 13

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: x

Tutor: Exactly! To get x alone, we need to undo the operations. What operation is being applied to x first?

Student: Adding 5

Tutor: Right! So if we're adding 5, how can we undo that? What's the opposite of addition?

Student: Subtraction

Tutor: Perfect! So what should we do to both sides of the equation?

Student: Subtract 5

Tutor: Excellent! So if we subtract 5 from both sides, what does the equation become?

Student: 2x = 8

Tutor: Great! Now we have 2x = 8. What operation is still being applied to x?

Student: Multiplying by 2

Tutor: Correct! And how do we undo multiplication?

Student: Divide by 2

Tutor: Exactly! So what do we get when we divide both sides by 2?

Student: x = 4

Tutor: Perfect! You've solved it! Let's verify: if x = 4, then 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13. That's correct!
```

### Interaction Flow

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: Sarah drives 60 miles per hour. How long does it take her to drive 180 miles?

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: How long it takes

Tutor: Good! What information do we have in the problem?

Student: She drives 60 miles per hour and needs to go 180 miles

Tutor: Perfect! Now, what relationship connects speed, distance, and time?

Student: Distance equals speed times time

Tutor: Exactly! So we have distance = speed × time. Can you write that as an equation using the numbers from the problem?

Student: 180 = 60 × time

Tutor: Great! Or we could write it as 180 = 60t. Now, what do we need to do to solve for t?

Student: Divide both sides by 60

Tutor: Perfect! So what does t equal?

Student: t = 3

Tutor: Excellent work! So it takes 3 hours. Does that make sense? If she drives 60 miles per hour, in 3 hours she'd go 180 miles - that checks out!

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: 3x - 7 = 14

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: x

Tutor: Exactly! To get x alone, we need to undo the operations. What operation is being applied to x first?

Student: I don't know

Tutor: That's okay! Let's think about it. We have 3x - 7. What two things are happening to x?

Student: I'm not sure

Tutor: No problem! Let's break it down. The expression 3x - 7 means we're multiplying x by 3, and then subtracting 7. To isolate x, we need to undo these operations. Which operation should we undo first - the subtraction or the multiplication?

Student: I don't understand

Tutor: Let's think about it like this: if you have 3x - 7 = 14, and you want to get x alone, you need to "undo" the -7 first. What's the opposite of subtracting 7?

Student: Adding 7

Tutor: Perfect! So what should we add to both sides of the equation?

Student: 7

Tutor: Excellent! So if we add 7 to both sides, what does the equation become?

Student: 3x = 21

Tutor: Great! Now we have 3x = 21. What's the next step?

Student: Divide by 3

Tutor: Perfect! So what does x equal?

Student: x = 7

Tutor: Excellent! You got it! Let's check: 3(7) - 7 = 21 - 7 = 14. That's correct!
```

### Interaction Flow

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: A store has a 20% off sale. If an item originally costs $50, what's the sale price?

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: The sale price

Tutor: Good! What information do we have?

Student: Original price is $50 and there's 20% off

Tutor: Perfect! Now, when we say 20% off, what does that mean?

Student: We take away 20% of the price

Tutor: Right! So there are two ways to think about this. We could find the discount and subtract it, or we could find what percentage we're actually paying. Which approach do you want to use?

Student: Find the discount

Tutor: Good approach! So first, what's 20% of $50?

Student: I'm not sure how to calculate that

Tutor: That's okay! To find a percentage, we multiply the number by the percentage as a decimal. What's 20% as a decimal?

Student: 0.20

Tutor: Perfect! So what's 0.20 × 50?

Student: 10

Tutor: Excellent! So the discount is $10. Now, what's the sale price?

Student: 50 - 10 = 40

Tutor: Perfect! So the sale price is $40. Does that make sense? If we take 20% off $50, we get $40. Great work!
```
