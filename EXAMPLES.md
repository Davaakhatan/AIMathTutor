## Example 1: Simple Algebra - Solving for x

**Problem**: `2x + 5 = 13`

### Interaction Flow

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: 2x + 5 = 13

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: x

Tutor: Exactly! To get x alone, we need to undo the operations. What operation is being applied to x first?

Student: Adding 5

Tutor: Right! So if we're adding 5, how can we undo that? What's the opposite of addition?

Student: Subtraction

Tutor: Perfect! So what should we do to both sides of the equation?

Student: Subtract 5

Tutor: Excellent! So if we subtract 5 from both sides, what does the equation become?

Student: 2x = 8

Tutor: Great! Now we have 2x = 8. What operation is still being applied to x?

Student: Multiplying by 2

Tutor: Correct! And how do we undo multiplication?

Student: Divide by 2

Tutor: Exactly! So what do we get when we divide both sides by 2?

Student: x = 4

Tutor: Perfect! You've solved it! Let's verify: if x = 4, then 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13. That's correct!
```

### Key Teaching Moments
- Tutor never gave direct answer
- Guided student to identify operations
- Helped discover inverse operations
- Encouraged verification at the end

## Example 2: Word Problem - Rate and Distance

**Problem**: "Sarah drives 60 miles per hour. How long does it take her to drive 180 miles?"

### Interaction Flow

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: Sarah drives 60 miles per hour. How long does it take her to drive 180 miles?

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: How long it takes

Tutor: Good! What information do we have in the problem?

Student: She drives 60 miles per hour and needs to go 180 miles

Tutor: Perfect! Now, what relationship connects speed, distance, and time?

Student: Distance equals speed times time

Tutor: Exactly! So we have distance = speed × time. Can you write that as an equation using the numbers from the problem?

Student: 180 = 60 × time

Tutor: Great! Or we could write it as 180 = 60t. Now, what do we need to do to solve for t?

Student: Divide both sides by 60

Tutor: Perfect! So what does t equal?

Student: t = 3

Tutor: Excellent work! So it takes 3 hours. Does that make sense? If she drives 60 miles per hour, in 3 hours she'd go 180 miles - that checks out!
```

### Key Teaching Moments
- Helped identify given information
- Guided to recall formula
- Encouraged setting up equation
- Verified answer makes sense

## Example 3: Geometry - Area of Circle

**Problem**: "Find the area of a circle with radius 5"

### Interaction Flow

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: Find the area of a circle with radius 5

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: The area

Tutor: Good! What information are we given?

Student: The radius is 5

Tutor: Perfect! What's the formula for the area of a circle?

Student: π times r squared

Tutor: Exactly! So A = πr². Now, what value should we substitute for r?

Student: 5

Tutor: Right! So what does the equation become?

Student: A = π × 5²

Tutor: Good! Now, what's 5²?

Student: 25

Tutor: Perfect! So A = π × 25, or A = 25π. If we want a numerical approximation, what value would we use for π?

Student: 3.14

Tutor: Great! So A ≈ 25 × 3.14. What does that equal?

Student: 78.5

Tutor: Excellent! So the area is approximately 78.5 square units (or exactly 25π if we leave it in terms of π). Great work!
```

### Key Teaching Moments
- Guided to recall formula
- Helped with substitution
- Encouraged calculation step-by-step
- Discussed exact vs approximate answer

## Example 4: Student Getting Stuck - Hint Escalation

**Problem**: `3x - 7 = 14`

### Interaction Flow (Showing Escalation)

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: 3x - 7 = 14

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: x

Tutor: Exactly! To get x alone, we need to undo the operations. What operation is being applied to x first?

Student: I don't know

Tutor: That's okay! Let's think about it. We have 3x - 7. What two things are happening to x?

Student: I'm not sure

Tutor: No problem! Let's break it down. The expression 3x - 7 means we're multiplying x by 3, and then subtracting 7. To isolate x, we need to undo these operations. Which operation should we undo first - the subtraction or the multiplication?

Student: I don't understand

Tutor: Let's think about it like this: if you have 3x - 7 = 14, and you want to get x alone, you need to "undo" the -7 first. What's the opposite of subtracting 7?

Student: Adding 7

Tutor: Perfect! So what should we add to both sides of the equation?

Student: 7

Tutor: Excellent! So if we add 7 to both sides, what does the equation become?

Student: 3x = 21

Tutor: Great! Now we have 3x = 21. What's the next step?

Student: Divide by 3

Tutor: Perfect! So what does x equal?

Student: x = 7

Tutor: Excellent! You got it! Let's check: 3(7) - 7 = 21 - 7 = 14. That's correct!
```

### Key Teaching Moments
- Escalated hints when student was stuck
- Provided more specific guidance
- Used analogies to help understanding
- Maintained encouragement throughout

## Example 5: Multi-Step Problem

**Problem**: "Solve for x: 2(x + 3) - 5 = 11"

### Interaction Flow

```
Tutor: I see you're working on: 2(x + 3) - 5 = 11

Let's work through this together! What are we trying to find or solve in this problem?

Student: x

Tutor: Good! This is a multi-step problem. What should we do first?

Student: Distribute the 2

Tutor: Perfect! So what does 2(x + 3) become?

Student: 2x + 6

Tutor: Excellent! So the equation becomes 2x + 6 - 5 = 11. Can we simplify the left side?

Student: Yes, 6 - 5 = 1

Tutor: Great! So now we have 2x + 1 = 11. What's the next step?

Student: Subtract 1

Tutor: Perfect! So what does the equation become?

Student: 2x = 10

Tutor: Excellent! Now what's the final step?

Student: Divide by 2

Tutor: Perfect! So what does x equal?

Student: x = 5

Tutor: Wonderful! You solved it step by step. Let's verify: 2(5 + 3) - 5 = 2(8) - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11. Correct!
```

### Key Teaching Moments
- Broke down multi-step problem
- Guided through each step
- Encouraged simplification
- Verified final answer

## Notes for Testing

When testing the application, try:
1. **Various problem types** - arithmetic, algebra, geometry, word problems
2. **Different response patterns** - correct answers, incorrect answers, confused responses
3. **Stuck scenarios** - see how hint escalation works
4. **Multi-turn conversations** - verify context is maintained
5. **Edge cases** - very short responses, very long responses, off-topic responses

The tutor should always maintain the Socratic method and never give direct answers, even when students are stuck.
