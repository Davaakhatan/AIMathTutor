## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended: Node.js 20+)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd AITutor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file
   touch .env.local
   ```
   
   Add the following to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
   
   **Note**: Make sure there are no leading/trailing spaces in your API key!

4. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   # Standard dev server
   npm run dev
   
   # Or use the start script (stops any existing process on port 3002)
   ./start
   ```
   
   The start script (`./start`) will:
   - Stop any process running on port 3002
   - Start the dev server on port 3002
   - Ensure `.env.local` is reloaded

5. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) (or port shown in terminal)

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### API Key Management

The app supports multiple ways to provide your OpenAI API key:

1. **Environment Variable** (Recommended for local development)
   - Add to `.env.local`: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key`
   - Restart dev server after adding/changing

2. **Settings Panel** (Fallback for deployed apps)
   - Open Settings (gear icon)
   - Enter API key in the input field
   - Key is stored in browser localStorage
   - Works as fallback when environment variable is not available

3. **Deployment** (AWS Amplify, Vercel, etc.)
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to environment variables in your deployment platform
   - No need to set it in Settings panel

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel

See [VERCEL_SETUP.md](./VERCEL_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

Quick steps:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to environment variables
4. Deploy

### AWS Amplify

1. Connect GitHub repository to AWS Amplify
2. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to environment variables:
   - Go to App Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your key value
3. Deploy

### Docker

A `Dockerfile` is included for containerized deployments:

```bash
docker build -t ai-math-tutor .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key ai-math-tutor
```

## 📖 Example Interaction

```
Student: [uploads "2x + 5 = 13"]
Tutor: "What are we trying to find?"
Student: "x"
Tutor: "Right! To get x alone, we need to undo the +5 and ×2. Which should we undo first?"
Student: "the +5?"
Tutor: "Exactly! How do we undo adding 5?"
Student: "subtract 5"
Tutor: "Perfect! So what happens when we subtract 5 from both sides?"
```

## 🧪 Testing

## 🏗️ Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed system design.

**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS, KaTeX
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4 (Vision + Dialogue)
- **State Management**: React hooks, localStorage
- **Deployment**: Vercel, AWS Amplify, Docker

**Key Components**:
- `services/problemParser.ts` - Parse problems from text/images
- `services/dialogueManager.ts` - Orchestrate conversations
- `services/contextManager.ts` - Manage session context (with global storage for dev mode)
- `services/socraticPromptEngine.ts` - Generate Socratic prompts
- `components/chat/ChatUI.tsx` - Main chat interface
- `components/ProblemHistory.tsx` - Problem history and bookmarks
- `components/LearningDashboard.tsx` - Learning analytics

## 📝 Socratic Approach

The system follows these principles:
1. **Never give direct answers** - Only guide through questions
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Start broad, narrow to specifics
3. **Adaptive scaffolding** - Increase hints if stuck >2 turns
4. **Encouraging language** - Positive reinforcement throughout
5. **Completion recognition** - Detect when student solves the problem and celebrate

All responses are dynamically generated by OpenAI GPT-4 using carefully crafted Socratic prompts. There are no hardcoded responses or fallbacks.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Issue: OpenAI API errors**
- Verify your API key is correct in `.env.local` (no leading/trailing spaces)
- Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
- Ensure the API key has access to GPT-4 models
- Try entering the API key in Settings panel as fallback
- Restart dev server after changing `.env.local`

**Issue: Sessions disappearing**
- Fixed: Sessions now persist across hot reloads using global storage
- If issues persist, check browser console for errors

**Issue: Progress shows "Solved!" incorrectly**
- Fixed: Progress detection now uses definitive completion phrases
- Only shows "Solved!" when tutor explicitly confirms completion

**Issue: Image parsing not working**
- Ensure images are in JPG or PNG format
- Check file size is under 10MB
- Verify OpenAI Vision API access

**Issue: Math equations not rendering**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure KaTeX CSS is loaded
- Verify LaTeX syntax in responses

**Issue: API key not working in deployed app**
- Check environment variables are set in deployment platform
- Use Settings panel to enter API key as fallback
- Verify API key format (should start with `sk-` or `sk-proj-`)
